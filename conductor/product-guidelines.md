# Product Guidelines - Recipe API

## Communication Style
- **Tone:** Professional and Efficient.
- **Language:** Clear, concise, and focused on functional utility. Documentation should be direct and easy for developers to navigate.

## Data Design Standards
- **Structure:** Enforce a standardized structure for ingredients, quantities, and instructions to ensure consistency across different user interfaces and data consumers.
- **Interoperability:** Prioritize formats that are easily parsed and displayed by various mobile and web applications.

## Design Principles
- **Developer First:** The API should be highly intuitive for front-end developers, with clear endpoints, consistent naming conventions, and comprehensive documentation.
- **Predictability:** Ensure consistent behavior across all endpoints to reduce the learning curve and potential for integration errors.

## Error Handling & Feedback
- **Semantic Errors:** Use specific, well-documented HTTP status codes and custom error objects to provide clear feedback.
- **Actionable Insights:** Error messages should be descriptive enough for developers to quickly identify and resolve issues.
